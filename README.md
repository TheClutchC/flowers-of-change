Attempt at completing a project with another person in an organized manner

A collab between TheClutchC and willow-luna

Make a goal of using comments within html and css to help explain reasoning behind certain coding decisions so the other person can follow along easier with your own creative flow and understand the why behind certain decisions. Comments can be as long as needed to explain why you did what you did.

Also, making consistent and concise git commit messages with the purpose of explaining what you add, remove, alter, change, etc. Use present tense!

In summary, git commits for what you did, and comments for why.

Challenge: Complete in three, possibly two days with good communication and just try to focus on the end goal of making the website in a timely manner with minimal time lost on menial tasks(super specific pictures, altering color combos, etc.)

Go team!
